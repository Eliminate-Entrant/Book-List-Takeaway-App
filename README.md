# Book-List-Takeaway-App

### Homework Assignment: Book List Tracker App

#### Overview:
Create a basic Flutter app for managing a collection of books. The app should have two main pages: Home (Book List) and Add Book. **The project should not take longer than 3-4 hours**.

#### Page 1: Home Page (Book List)
- Display a scrollable list of books with their titles and authors.
- Each book item should be tappable, leading to a placeholder Book Details page.
- Implement a feature to delete a book by swiping or tapping on a delete icon next to each book.

#### Page 2: Add Book Title
- Implement a form for adding a new book with fields for title and author.
- Add basic validation to ensure that the title and author fields are not empty.
- Include a button to submit the new book and return to the Home page.

For the book data, use the provided `book_data.json` file. You are free to handle it however. When adding a new Book Title, the json data should update.

#### Requirements:
- Use Flutter and Dart for development.
- Use a state management solution (e.g., `Provider` or `StatefulWidget`) for managing the app's state, feel free to use other state management libraries.
- Implement a simple navigation solution (e.g., `Navigator`) for transitioning between pages.
- Follow Flutter best practices for code structure and readability.
- Ensure a clean and organized project structure.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
1. **UI/UX Design:** Evaluating the design, layout, and overall user experience.
2. **State Management:** Assess how well the app's state is being managed.
3. **Navigation:** Check if the navigation between pages is intuitive.
4. **Code Quality:** Code structure, readability, and organization will be heavily assessed on. Choose meaningful variable and function names.
5. **Functionality:** Ensure that basic features are implemented correctly.

### Submission:
You should submit a compressed folder containing the entire Flutter project with clear instructions on how to run the app locally. Additionally, provide a brief README file explaining your design decisions and any challenges faced during the development.

The UI/UX is intentially open-ended where we want to see your UI designs and implementation. **Please do not spend more than 3-4 hours on this app**.
